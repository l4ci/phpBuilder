## What is this?

Basically just a collection of stuff (php functions) I really use a lot in different web-projects.
Im always working on it, to create a 'kinda'-phpFramework for my personal needs.


## How to use it (WORKING ON THAT)
All you do is build your site structure and css file. I am working with CodeKit (https://incident57.com/codekit/), that's why there is a .less AND .css file. You cut the static parts into snippets (so you can re-use them easily) and you fill content in the different pages, where home.php in /content is your starting page.

Open the config.php to configure some functions, or delete unneeded ones from the index.php.


- auto including function/lib files from /lib
- auto including any js file from /js
- files.php in /content become available as <a href="/file">
- files.php in /snippets can be implemented anywhere via snippet('files')


# lib

### basic.php

init_content	: reads /content folder and makes them available as pages
error		: give an error message and/or dies
snippet		: implements a snippet file from /snippets folder
	
		 
### Language Function

For different language support, create language files (en/de/fr/etc.php) in /lang then you can use $t['text'] in your /content


### various.php functions

init_google	: adds the google analytics code (need to enter your id in config, or as parameter)
init_addthis	: add the addthis.com sharing code
bitly		: creates a bit.ly url (need to enter your login&api key)
get_gravatar 	: returns the url to the gravatar image (if available for email address)
no_javascript	: creates a link to enable-javascript.com, if javascript is disabled
